                of products that may be of interest to them may at any time remove themselves from the intended
                audience.</p>

                the customer.</p>

                confidential. A third party is, for example, our partner, whose job is to transport goods for sale in an
                e-shop or to provide hire purchase services.</p>
            <p>Tukan OU will retain the Customer's personal data until the termination of the Loyal Customer Agreement.
                Data that Tukan OU is obliged to retain for legal purposes (eg accounting data) shall be stored by Tukan

                section of our website.</p>
            <p>If the e-mail (username of the Tukan OU website) changes, please let us know as it cannot be changed by

                protect the Customer's personal data. Only authorized persons may access and modify the data.</p>

                risk of leaking your information to strangers, please let us know immediately. Only in this way can we
                keep the potential damage to a minimum.</p>
            <p>The Customer shall have the right to request the termination of the processing of his or her data,
                information on the use of the data and the transmission of the data to himself or to a third party in a
                commonly used format. In order to avoid misuse of customer data and rights, applications may only be
                submitted in a form that identifies the applicant (digitally signed or personally signed at the
                representative office). We have 30 days to respond to such requests.</p>
            <p>We shall treat a claim for termination of data processing as an application for termination of a loyal
                customer agreement. </p>

                are treated as confidential information. An encrypted communication channel with banks ensures the
                security of the purchaser's personal data and bank details.</p>
